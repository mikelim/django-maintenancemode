django-maintenancemode
======================

django-maintenancemode is a middleware that allows you to temporary shutdown
your site for maintenance work.

Logged in users having staff credentials can still fully use
the site as can users visiting the site from an ip address defined in
Django's INTERNAL_IPS.


Installation
============

* Download django-maintenancemode from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-maintenancemode
  or http://code.google.com/p/django-maintenancemode/
* Install using: `python setup.py install`
* In your Django settings file add maintenancemode to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.
  Make sure it comes after Django's AuthenticationMiddleware. Like so::

   MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
       'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
       'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
       'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
       'django.middleware.doc.XViewMiddleware',
   
       'maintenancemode.middleware.MaintenanceModeMiddleware',
   )

* django-maintenancemode works the same way as handling 404 or 500 error in
  Django work. It adds a handler503 which you can override in your main urls.py
  or you can add a 503.html to your templates directory.
* In your Django settings file add a variable called MAINTENANCE_MODE. Setting
  this variable to True activates the middleware.


Configuration
=============
If you do not configure the settings below in your own project settings.py,
they assume default values:

MAINTENANCE_MODE
  Boolean. Enable/disable maintenance mode.
  Default: False

DISPLAY_MAINTENANCE_PAGE
  Function to determine if the maintenance mode page should be displayed. Sometimes, it's a good idea
  to enable static parts of the website to be displayed, while showing the maintenance page to the 
  dynamic parts of the website. This function allows you to set your own custom rules:
  
  The default function has the following rules:
	* If user is logged in and staff member, the maintenance page is
	  not displayed.

	* If user's ip is in INTERNAL_IPS, the maintenance page is
	  not displayed.

MAINTENANCE_PAGE_CONTEXT
  Dictionary. The context object to pass into the maintenance page. 
  Default: Empty dictionary {}
